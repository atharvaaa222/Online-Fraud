# Online Fraud Detection

## Project Description
Developed an online fraud detection model using machine learning algorithms in Python. The model aims to identify fraudulent transactions based on various features such as transaction type, amount, and account balances. The dataset is preprocessed, and a Decision Tree Classifier is used to train and evaluate the model's performance.
